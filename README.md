# Hi, I'm Rory

I'm a Behavioural Data Scientist at Good With, a startup focused on improving financial wellbeing in young adults. I'm also finishing up my PhD in psychology at the University of Plymouth, UK.

I mostly maintain private repos relating to my psychological research on this account, but I also host and collaborate on some public projects here.

For more information about me, visit my website at [roryspanton.com](www.roryspanton.com). For my writing, check out my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@roryspanton).
