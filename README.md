# Hi, I'm Rory

I'm a PhD Researcher at the University of Plymouth, UK. I have a range of interests that include **psychology**, **data science**, and **R programming**.

I mostly maintain private repos relating to my research, but also I host and collaborate on some public R programming projects.

For more information about me and my academic work, visit my personal website at [roryspanton.com](www.roryspanton.com). For my writing, check out my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@roryspanton).
